# Bash Scripts

That's my repo of my shell bash scripts and projects and i will document everything, my brainstorm, my roadmap to learning and execute my ideas.

The book or better e-book i use to learn is present on this repository: **https://github.com/bobbyiliev/introduction-to-bash-scripting**  
It's very easy to understand, the examples, the writing is so easy to read.

And i use the Bash4Noobs in this repo: **https://github.com/DantasB/Bash4Noobs**
4Noobs is a project for beginners, have a lot languages, frameworks etc.. and i use this too.

I thing this repo helps to anyone to learn Bash or other shell scripts.

Enjoy it :)
