# Firsts Projects

All right this is my read me file of my projects and i will list my difficulties and how i can organized everything.

### First Project

- Status Script
I write this script following the book, i have to fail find some things and i literally copy of book.
After the read the book and write the code, i will find some new things to put on the code and learn more Linux commands etc, that's make me happy.
Ok, after that i finish the first part, write the first mini projects, and i think ok, what i do now?
  - All right i have a script with show the basic system usage with CPU and CPU LOAD, and i put the architecture for example, and i do that. 
After that put new functionalities, i have the second part, the menu.
  - The menu at the first read it seemed to me little hard, but i read again and try understand the code, and i do that, basically i create a variable colors, after that create a function with them.
  - Finally create the last function "menu" with case statement. That's seems to me little hard to understand in the first read, but according i read the code i will understand.
